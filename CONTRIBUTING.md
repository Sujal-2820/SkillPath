# Contributing to JSON

If you don't have technical knowledge about **JavaScript** or it's framework **Next JS** , no problemo ðŸ˜„.

You still have a chance to contribute to a non technical but a *very crucial* portion of the project.

It holds all the data that needs to be presented for each modules.
<br/>
<br/>
The name of the folder is **courseFolder**.
<br/>
Explaination:
   - Open ```courseFolder```.
   - You will see various sub folders namely *ai-ml*, *app_development*, *data_analysis* and *web_development*. These are basically the domains which consist of courses and modules.
   - There are folders nested inside these domains which contain individual course information i.e. ```modules```.
   - Each module folder contains 3 difficulties namely *standard*, *easy* and *easiest*. As the name suggests the difficulty level of each modules decreases according to the names (in terms of ```wordings```, ```description```, ```video_links``` etc.)
