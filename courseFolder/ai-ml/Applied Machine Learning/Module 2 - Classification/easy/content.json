    "text": "Classification is a fundamental technique in machine learning, used to categorize data into predefined classes based on input features. It involves training a model on labeled data, allowing it to learn the relationship between features and the corresponding class labels. Once trained, the model can predict the class of unseen instances. This method is widely applied in various domains, from spam detection in emails to image recognition in photos."

        "text": "Classification is a type of supervised learning where the algorithm learns from labeled data. The primary goal is to assign a class label to new instances based on the learned patterns. The dataset used for training contains both input features and their associated class labels.",
        "additional_text": "For example, in a dataset of emails, the input features might include the presence of certain keywords, and the class labels could be 'spam' or 'not spam'. The model learns from this labeled data to make predictions on new emails.",
        "more_additional_text": "There are two main types of classification tasks:\n- **Binary Classification**: The model predicts one of two classes (e.g., spam or not spam).\n- **Multi-Class Classification**: The model predicts one class from multiple possible classes (e.g., classifying different species of flowers).",

It indicates how many actual positive cases were captured by the model.\n- **F1 Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a single score that balances both metrics.\n- **Confusion Matrix**: A table that summarizes the performance of a classification model by showing the true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative predictions.",
