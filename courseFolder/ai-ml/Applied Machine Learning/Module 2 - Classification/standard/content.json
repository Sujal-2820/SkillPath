    "text": "Classification is a supervised machine learning technique used to predict the categorical label of new observations based on past data. Unlike regression, which predicts continuous outcomes, classification aims to categorize data into discrete classes. It is widely used in various applications, such as spam detection, sentiment analysis, and image recognition."

        "additionalText": "Common examples of classification tasks include:\n- Email classification (spam or not spam)\n- Image classification (identifying objects within an image)\n- Medical diagnosis (classifying diseases based on symptoms)\n- Sentiment analysis (determining whether a review is positive or negative)",
