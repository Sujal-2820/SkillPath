    "text": "Classification is one of the core techniques in machine learning, crucial for categorizing data into predefined classes based on input features. In this process, a model is trained on labeled data, learning the relationship between the input features and their corresponding class labels. After training, the model can then predict the class of new, unseen data. This approach is prevalent in various applications, including spam detection, image recognition, and medical diagnosis."

        "additional_text": "For instance, in a dataset of emails, the input features might include keywords and phrases, while the class labels could be 'spam' or 'not spam'. The model learns from this data, allowing it to accurately classify new emails.",
        "more_additional_text": "Classification can be categorized into two main types:\n- **Binary Classification**: The model predicts one of two classes. For example, distinguishing between 'spam' and 'not spam' emails.\n- **Multi-Class Classification**: The model predicts one class from multiple possible classes, such as classifying different types of flowers based on several features.",
