          "text": "There are several algorithms used for clustering, each with its strengths and weaknesses. Some of the most common clustering algorithms include:\n\n1. **K-Means Clustering**: This algorithm divides the dataset into K distinct clusters. Each data point is assigned to the nearest cluster centroid, and centroids are updated based on the mean of the assigned points.\n\n2. **Hierarchical Clustering**: This method builds a hierarchy of clusters. It can be agglomerative (starting with individual points and merging them) or divisive (starting with one cluster and splitting it).",
          "additional_text": "3. **DBSCAN**: This algorithm identifies clusters based on the density of data points. It can find clusters of arbitrary shapes and is robust to noise in the data.\n\n4. **Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)**: This probabilistic model assumes that the data is generated from a mixture of several Gaussian distributions. GMM can capture more complex cluster shapes than K-Means.",

However, we can use several metrics to assess the quality of our clustering:\n\n1. **Silhouette Score**: This metric measures how similar a data point is to its own cluster compared to other clusters. A score closer to +1 indicates that the data points are well clustered.\n\n2. **Davies-Bouldin Index**: This index evaluates the average similarity ratio of each cluster with its most similar cluster. A lower value indicates better clustering.",
