The algorithm iteratively assigns data points to the nearest cluster centroid and updates the centroids based on the mean of the assigned points.\n- **Hierarchical Clustering**: This algorithm builds a hierarchy of clusters either through a bottom-up approach (agglomerative) or a top-down approach (divisive). It is useful for visualizing data relationships through dendrograms.\n- **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise)**: DBSCAN groups together points that are closely packed and marks as outliers points that lie alone in low-density regions. This is particularly effective in identifying clusters of arbitrary shapes and handling noise in the data.",
