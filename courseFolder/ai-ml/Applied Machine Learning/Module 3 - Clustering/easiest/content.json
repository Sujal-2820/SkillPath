Some popular ones include:\n\n1. **K-Means Clustering**: This algorithm divides data into K clusters based on the mean of the data points in each cluster. It’s efficient and works well for spherical clusters.\n\n2. **Hierarchical Clustering**: This approach builds a hierarchy of clusters. It can be agglomerative (bottom-up) or divisive (top-down).",
        "additional_text": "3. **DBSCAN**: This algorithm finds clusters based on the density of data points, allowing it to discover clusters of varying shapes and sizes while ignoring noise.\n\n4. **Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)**: This model assumes that the data is generated from a mixture of several Gaussian distributions, providing flexibility in modeling complex data distributions.",

However, we can use several methods to assess clustering performance:\n\n1. **Silhouette Score**: Measures how similar a data point is to its own cluster compared to other clusters. A higher score indicates better clustering.\n\n2. **Davies-Bouldin Index**: This index evaluates the average similarity ratio of each cluster with its most similar cluster. Lower values indicate better clustering.",
