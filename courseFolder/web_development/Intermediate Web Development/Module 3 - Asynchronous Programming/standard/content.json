        "text": "Asynchronous programming is a powerful concept in JavaScript that allows your code to perform tasks without blocking the execution of other code. This is especially useful for tasks like network requests, file reading, or any operation that might take time to complete.",
        "additional_text": "In synchronous programming, tasks are executed one after another. However, in asynchronous programming, tasks can be initiated, and while waiting for them to finish, other code can continue to run.",

        "subheading": "Callback Functions",
        "text": "A callback function is a function that is passed into another function as an argument and is executed after the completion of that function. Callbacks are a common way to handle asynchronous operations.",
        "code_example": [
          {
            "filename": "Using Callback Functions",
            "code": "function fetchData(callback) {\n  setTimeout(() => {\n    const data = 'Data fetched!';\n    callback(data);\n  }, 2000);\n}\n\nfetchData((result) => {\n  console.log(result);\n});"
          }
        ],

        "subheading": "Promises: A Better Way to Handle Asynchronous Operations",
        "text": "Promises are objects that represent the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. A promise can be in one of three states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected.",

        "subheading": "Async/Await: A Syntactic Sugar for Promises",
        "text": "Async/await is a modern way to work with promises that allows you to write asynchronous code that looks and behaves like synchronous code. You can use the `async` keyword to declare a function that will return a promise, and `await` can be used to pause the execution until the promise is resolved.",

          }
        ],
        "additional_text": "In this example, `getData` is an asynchronous function that awaits the result of `fetchData`. If the promise is fulfilled, it logs the result; if it is rejected, it catches and logs the error."

        "subheading": "Error Handling in Asynchronous Code",
        "text": "Proper error handling is crucial in asynchronous programming to ensure that your application behaves predictably. With promises, you can use `.catch()` to handle errors. With async/await, you can use `try/catch` blocks.",
