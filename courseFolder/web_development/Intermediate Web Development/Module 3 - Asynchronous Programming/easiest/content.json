        "subheading": "What Is Asynchronous Programming?",
        "text": "Asynchronous programming allows JavaScript to do many things at once. It lets your program ask for something (like data from a server) and keep running without waiting for the answer. This means your web app can stay responsive and not freeze up while it waits.",
        "additional_text": "Imagine you are at a cafÃ©. You order coffee (this is like asking for data), and while the barista prepares your coffee, you can check your phone or chat with friends. That's asynchronous programming!",

            "options": [
              "It makes your program run faster.",
              "It allows your program to do other things while waiting for a task to finish.",

        "subheading": "Understanding Callback Functions",
        "text": "A callback function is a way to say, 'When you're done, call me back!' In JavaScript, we use callbacks to handle tasks that take time. For example, when we request data from a server, we can tell the program what to do when the data arrives.",
        "code_example": [
          {
            "filename": "Callback Function Example",
            "code": "function getData(callback) {\n  setTimeout(() => {\n    const data = 'Here is your data!';\n    callback(data);\n  }, 2000);\n}\n\ngetData((result) => {\n  console.log(result);\n});"
          }
        ],
        "additional_text": "In this example, `getData` simulates getting data after 2 seconds. When the data is ready, it calls the `callback`, which logs the result to the console."

      {
        "subheading": "Introduction to Promises",
        "text": "Promises are a way to deal with asynchronous tasks that make it easier to manage what happens when a task is done. A promise is like a promise you make to someone: you say, 'I will do this, and if I succeed, I will let you know.'",
        "code_example": [
          {
            "filename": "Promise Example",

          }
        ],
        "additional_text": "In this example, `fetchData` creates a promise. After 2 seconds, it either resolves (successful) or rejects (failed), and we handle each case using `.then()` and `.catch()`."
      },
      {
        "subheading": "Making It Easier with Async/Await",
        "text": "Async/await is a simpler way to write asynchronous code. You can use `async` before a function to make it asynchronous, and use `await` to pause the code until the promise is resolved. This makes your code cleaner and easier to read.",

          {

          }
        ],
        "additional_text": "Here, `getUserData` waits for `fetchData` to finish. If it succeeds, it logs the result; if it fails, it catches the error."
      },
      {
        "subheading": "How to Handle Errors",
        "text": "It's important to handle errors in asynchronous programming. You can use `.catch()` with promises or `try/catch` blocks in async functions to catch and respond to errors.",
        "code_example": [
          {
            "filename": "Error Handling Example",

        "subheading": "Making API Calls",
        "text": "You often use asynchronous programming to make API calls to get data from servers. This allows your web applications to stay interactive while fetching information.",
