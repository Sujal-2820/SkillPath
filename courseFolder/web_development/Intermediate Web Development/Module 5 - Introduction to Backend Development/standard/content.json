        "text": "Backend development refers to the server-side part of web development. It's everything that happens behind the scenes when you interact with a website or web application. The backend consists of the server, databases, and application logic, working together to handle requests from the frontend and respond appropriately.",
        "additional_text": "Think of the backend as the 'brains' of a website. While the frontend is what users see and interact with, the backend handles how that interaction is processed. It fetches data, manages it, and sends the results back to the user."

      {
        "subheading": "Why is Backend Important?",
        "text": "Without the backend, web applications would not be able to process user requests, store data, or communicate with databases. It's critical for tasks like authentication (logging in and out), data storage, processing form submissions, and more.",
        "additional_text": "Imagine you’re filling out a form on a website. The backend ensures that your data is saved and processed correctly, sending you the appropriate response—whether it’s confirming a successful signup or showing an error message if something went wrong.",
