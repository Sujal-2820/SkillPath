It’s like moving from making a simple cake to making a fancy, decorated one. Advanced skills let you organize your web pages better and add cool styles and animations.",

        "subheading": "Organizing Your HTML with Semantic Tags",
        "text": "Semantic HTML uses meaningful tags. Instead of using `<div>` for everything, you can use tags that describe their purpose, like `<header>` for the top of your page or `<footer>` for the bottom. This makes your HTML easier to understand for other people and search engines.",

        "text": "In CSS, selectors let you target specific elements to style. You already know class selectors (`.classname`) and ID selectors (`#idname`). But you can also target elements in other ways. For example, you can style an element based on an attribute or use `:hover` to change a style when the user hovers over something.",
