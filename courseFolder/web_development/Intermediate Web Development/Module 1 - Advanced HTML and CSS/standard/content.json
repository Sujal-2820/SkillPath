        "subheading": "Using Semantic HTML for Better Structure",
        "text": "Semantic HTML refers to using HTML elements according to their meaning rather than purely for styling purposes. For example, instead of using `<div>` tags for everything, you should use semantic elements like `<header>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, and `<footer>`. This not only improves the structure of your page but also helps with SEO and accessibility.",

        "subheading": "Understanding Advanced CSS Selectors",
        "text": "CSS selectors allow you to target HTML elements in a more specific way. Beyond basic selectors like classes (`.`) and IDs (`#`), there are advanced selectors that give you more control, such as attribute selectors, pseudo-classes, and combinators. These advanced selectors help in creating more flexible and reusable styles.",

          {
            "filename": "Advanced CSS Selectors",

        "text": "CSS Grid is a powerful layout system for creating complex, two-dimensional layouts with ease. Unlike Flexbox, which is ideal for one-dimensional layouts, Grid allows you to manage both rows and columns simultaneously. Let’s build a simple grid layout using Grid’s capabilities.",

        "subheading": "Using CSS Variables for Reusability",
        "text": "CSS variables, also known as custom properties, allow you to define values that can be reused throughout your stylesheet. This makes it easier to manage and maintain your styles, especially when you need to change a value in multiple places.",
