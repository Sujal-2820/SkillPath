        "text": "Have you ever wondered how websites are built? Web frameworks are like tools that help developers create websites more easily and quickly. They come with pre-written code, so you don’t have to start from scratch. There are two main types of web frameworks:\n\n1. **Frontend Frameworks**: These focus on what users see and interact with on a website. Popular examples include React, Angular, and Vue.js.\n2. **Backend Frameworks**: These handle the behind-the-scenes work, such as storing data and processing requests. Some common backend frameworks are Express.js, Django, and Ruby on Rails.",
