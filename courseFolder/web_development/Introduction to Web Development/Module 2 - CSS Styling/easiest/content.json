        "text": "CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a language used to style web pages. It allows you to change the look of your website without altering the HTML structure. With CSS, you can control colors, fonts, spacing, and the overall layout of your site. CSS makes your web pages visually appealing and helps you create a consistent style across your entire site.",

        "additional_text": "In the code above, we set the background color of the entire page to a light gray and selected the Verdana font for the text. You can change the color and font to match your design preferences.",

        "text": "CSS uses selectors to apply styles to specific HTML elements. You can select elements by their type (like `h1` or `p`), by their class (like `.highlight`), or by their ID (like `#main-header`). This means you can easily style multiple elements in different ways.",
        "code_example": "h1 {\n    color: blue;\n}\n\n.highlight {\n    background-color: yellow;\n    padding: 5px;\n}\n\n#main-header {\n    font-size: 30px;\n    text-align: center;\n}",
        "additional_text": "In this example, all `<h1>` elements will have blue text. Any element with the class 'highlight' will have a yellow background and some padding around the text. The element with the ID 'main-header' will have a larger font size and centered text.",
