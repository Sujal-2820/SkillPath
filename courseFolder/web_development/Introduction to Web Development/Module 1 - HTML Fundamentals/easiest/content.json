Just like your body has a structure that gives it shape, HTML gives structure to web content. It uses 'tags' to tell the web browser how to display text, images, and links. Every web page you see is built using HTML!",

Most tags come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag. The opening tag looks like this: <tagname>, and the closing tag looks like this: </tagname>. The content goes between these tags. For example, <p>This is a paragraph.</p> creates a paragraph.",

You can use <h1> to <h6> for headings, where <h1> is the largest and <h6> is the smallest. To group related content, you can use the <div> tag.
