The primary goal is to create a seamless user experience regardless of screen size. Responsive design uses flexible layouts, images, and CSS media queries to adjust the appearance of the website based on the user's device.",

        "subheading": "Key Principles of Responsive Design",
        "text": "There are several key principles that guide responsive design:\n- **Fluid Grids**: Layouts are built using relative units (like percentages) instead of fixed units (like pixels). This allows elements to resize according to the screen size.\n- **Flexible Images**: Images are scaled according to the size of their containing elements. This prevents images from overflowing or becoming too small on smaller screens.\n- **Media Queries**: CSS media queries allow you to apply different styles based on the device's characteristics, such as width, height, and orientation.",
        "additional_text": "By adhering to these principles, you ensure that your website adjusts smoothly to various screen sizes, enhancing the overall user experience.",

        "subheading": "Implementing Responsive Layouts with CSS",
        "text": "To create a responsive layout, you can use CSS Flexbox and Grid systems. These tools allow for flexible and adaptive designs.\n\n- **CSS Flexbox**: Flexbox provides a one-dimensional layout model that can distribute space dynamically within a container. You can control alignment, direction, and order of items, making it ideal for building responsive layouts.\n\n- **CSS Grid**: Grid layout offers a two-dimensional layout system, allowing you to design complex web layouts. You can define rows and columns and place elements within this grid structure.",
        "code_example": "// Example of a responsive Flexbox layout\n.container {\n    display: flex;\n    flex-wrap: wrap;\n    justify-content: space-between;\n}\n\n.item {\n    flex: 1 1 300px; /* Flex-grow, flex-shrink, flex-basis */\n    margin: 10px;\n}\n\n// Example of a responsive Grid layout\n.grid {\n    display: grid;\n    grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(200px, 1fr));\n    gap: 10px;\n}",
        "additional_text": "In the Flexbox example, the `.container` class sets up a flexible container that adjusts based on screen size. Each `.item` can grow or shrink to fit the available space. The Grid layout example uses `grid-template-columns` to create responsive columns that automatically adjust their size.",

        "text": "Images and media are crucial in web design. To ensure they are responsive, you can use the following techniques:\n- **CSS Properties**: Set the `max-width` of images to 100% to make them scale with their containers. This ensures that images do not overflow their parent elements.\n- **Srcset**: Use the `srcset` attribute in `<img>` tags to provide multiple image sources for different resolutions. This allows the browser to choose the most appropriate image based on the device's capabilities.",
        "code_example": "<img src='image-small.jpg' srcset='image-medium.jpg 600w, image-large.jpg 1200w' alt='Example image' style='max-width: 100%; height: auto;'>",
        "additional_text": "In this example, the `srcset` attribute allows the browser to select between small, medium, and large images based on the screen width. The `max-width: 100%` style ensures that the image scales properly within its container.",
