This means that users can easily read and navigate the site, no matter what device they're using.",

        "subheading": "Basic Techniques for Responsive Design",
        "text": "Here are some basic techniques used in responsive design:\n- **Fluid Grids**: Use percentages instead of pixels to define sizes. This allows elements to resize based on the screen size. For example, if you set a box to be 50%, it will take up half of the screen width, no matter how big or small the screen is.\n- **Flexible Images**: Make images responsive by setting their width to 100%. This ensures that images will scale down or up with the size of their containers.",
        "code_example": "// Example of a responsive box\n.box {\n    width: 50%; /* This box takes up half the screen width */\n    padding: 10px;\n}\n\n// Example of a responsive image\nimg {\n    width: 100%; /* This makes the image scale with its container */\n    height: auto;\n}",
        "additional_text": "In the above code, the `.box` class will always be half the width of the screen, while the image will resize to fit its container without losing its aspect ratio.",

For example, you might want to change the font size or hide certain elements when viewed on a smaller screen.",

        "additional_text": "In this example, if the screen width is 600 pixels or less, the text will have a smaller font size, and any element with the class `.hide-on-mobile` will be hidden.",
