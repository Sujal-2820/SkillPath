        "text": "Here are some simple ways to create a responsive design:\n- **Fluid Grids**: Instead of using fixed sizes (like 200 pixels), use percentages to define how wide things should be. For example, if you make a box 50%, it will always take up half the screen width.\n- **Flexible Images**: To make images responsive, set their width to 100%. This means they will scale up or down depending on the size of their container.",
        "code_example": "// Example of a responsive box\n.box {\n    width: 50%; /* Takes up half the screen */\n    padding: 10px;\n}\n\n// Example of a responsive image\nimg {\n    width: 100%; /* Scales with its container */\n    height: auto;\n}",
        "additional_text": "In this code, the `.box` class will always be half the width of the screen, while the image will adjust to fit perfectly within its container.",
