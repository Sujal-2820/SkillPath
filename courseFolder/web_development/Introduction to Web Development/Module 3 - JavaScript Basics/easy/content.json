        "text": "JavaScript is a programming language that allows you to make web pages interactive. Unlike HTML and CSS, which are used to structure and style web pages, JavaScript lets you create dynamic content. This means you can make things happen on a web page, like responding to clicks or changing content without refreshing the page.",

        "text": "Variables are like containers that store information. In JavaScript, you can create a variable using `let`, `const`, or `var`. Here's a quick guide:\n- **let**: You can change the value later.\n- **const**: The value can't be changed after it's set.\n- **var**: An older way to declare variables with a broader scope.",
        "code_example": "// Declaring variables\nlet myName = 'Alice';\nconst myAge = 25;\nvar isStudent = true;\n\nconsole.log(myName); // Outputs: Alice\nconsole.log(myAge); // Outputs: 25\nconsole.log(isStudent); // Outputs: true",
        "additional_text": "In the example above, we created three variables. `myName` can change if needed, while `myAge` will always be 25, and `isStudent` indicates whether the person is a student.",

Here are some common types:\n- **String**: Text wrapped in quotes (e.g., 'Hello')\n- **Number**: Numeric values (e.g., 42)\n- **Boolean**: True or false values\n- **Object**: A collection of related data (e.g., {name: 'Alice', age: 25})\n- **Array**: A list of values (e.g., [1, 2, 3])",
