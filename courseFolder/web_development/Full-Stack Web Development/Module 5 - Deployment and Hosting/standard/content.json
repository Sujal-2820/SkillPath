      "text": "Deployment is the process of making your web application available to users on the internet. It involves transferring your application code to a server where it can be accessed via a web browser. Essentially, deployment takes your code from a local environment (your computer) to a live environment (the internet).",

        "Shared Hosting: Multiple websites share the same server resources. It's cost-effective and easy to use but may have limitations on performance and customization.",
        "VPS (Virtual Private Server): A middle ground between shared hosting and dedicated servers. You get dedicated resources on a shared server, allowing for better performance and more control.",
        "Dedicated Hosting: You have an entire server to yourself. This option provides maximum control and performance but comes at a higher cost.",
        "Cloud Hosting: Utilizes a network of virtual servers. It's scalable, flexible, and often cost-effective, making it a popular choice for modern applications.",
