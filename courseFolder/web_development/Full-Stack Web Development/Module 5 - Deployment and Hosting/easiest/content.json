          "text": "Deployment refers to the process of making your web application accessible to users on the internet. Think of it as the bridge between your development environment and the world wide web. When you develop an application on your local machine, it's like working in a safe, closed-off environment. Deployment is the act of opening that environment up for everyone to see and use!",
          "additional_text": "To successfully deploy your application, you'll need to follow specific steps to ensure everything works as intended when it goes live. This is crucial, as users expect a flawless experience when they access your application.",
