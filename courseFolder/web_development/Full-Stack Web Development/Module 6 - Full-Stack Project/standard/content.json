      "text": "Full stack development involves working on both the front end and back end of a web application. The front end is the part of the application that users interact with directly, while the back end is responsible for managing the application's data and logic.",
      "additional_text": "A full stack developer has the skills to create an entire web application from the user interface (UI) to the server-side logic and database management. This versatility allows for a holistic understanding of how applications function, leading to better development practices and more efficient collaboration across teams.",
      "more_additional_text": "Typical components of a full stack project include a database (like MongoDB or PostgreSQL), a server-side language/framework (such as Node.js with Express), and a client-side framework or library (like React or Vue.js). Understanding how these technologies interact is crucial for creating a seamless application."
